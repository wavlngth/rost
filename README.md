Rost is a open-source, fully customisable Roblox group-focused Discord bot dedicated to making hosting trainings, shifts, openings and sessions easier and faster than ever before.

The bot doesn't take a lot of configuring; just change a few variables in the config.json file and you're good to go!

Official documentation will be released closer to the official release of the publicly hosted version of Rost, don't panic! For now, only use the Rost early code if you know what you're doing, as it's a bit dodgy right now!
